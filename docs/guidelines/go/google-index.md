## About
The Go Style Guide and accompanying documents codify the current best approaches for writing readable and idiomatic Go. Adherence to the Style Guide is not intended to be absolute, and these documents will never be exhaustive. Our intention is to minimize the guesswork of writing readable Go, helping newcomers avoid common mistakes. The Style Guide also unifies style guidance from code reviewers at Google.

## Definitions
### Canonical
Establishes prescriptive and enduring rules. All code (old and new) should follow these standards which are not expected to change substantially over time.

### Normative
Agreed-upon elements of style for use by Go code reviewers. These suggestions may change over time but are referenced in readability reviews.

### Idiomatic
Common and familiar patterns in Go code that are easy to recognize. Should be preferred over unidiomatic patterns serving the same purpose.
